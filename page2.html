<p> Bring it [Flirt Chaos – spoken/shouted to audience member]

Me: “Oi! Yeah, you there, with the muscles! Stop looking so smug, you little show-off… yeah, you know who you are!”
Crowd: cheers/laughs

Me: “Come on, babe! Don’t be shy… bring that over here!”
Crowd: shouts “BRING IT!”

Me (leaning in, chaotic, flirty):
“What’s your name? Huh? Don’t just stand there flexing like a daft plank… I like a man who can handle a bit of chaos. Can you handle me? Can you handle this madness?”
Crowd: laughs, whoops

Me (shouting):
“You think you’re fit? Ha! That’s cute… but can you survive a punk gig with me? Can you take my cat’s attitude, my FUDGE OFF energy, my honey chaos?!”
Crowd: shouts back “YEAH!”

Me (pointing, teasing):
“Come closer, or are you too scared? Oh, don’t be shy… bring your thing to me!”
Crowd: shouts “BRING IT!”

Me (laughing, dramatic, chaotic):
“I like it… I like it when they try… you lot are jealous now, aren’t ya? But this one’s mine for tonight! Just don’t fudge it up, babe… FUDGE OFF distractions!”
Crowd: cheers

Me (to audience member, playfully):
“And if you’re still thinking about Liam… F O Liam! F O Liam! Forget him, yeah? We’ve got chaos, we’ve got love, and we’ve got YOU!”
Crowd: chants “F O LIAM!”

<p>This is pure honey (Verse 1)
I can’t read, I can’t write,
Boss, shut the fudge up tonight.
“You serve that twat”—yeah, that’s your line,
I’m clocked out, fed up, outta my mind.

Fudge the landlord, fudge the rent,
All my letters come “urgent, urgent”.
Gas bill screaming through the door—
Who gives a frig anymore?

(Hook – shouted, messy, her signature line)
“I am not well… who gives a flying frickin’?”
Say it again, loud—heart still kickin’.
World on fire, I’m done with all that—
Back off, back off—who ya lookin’ at?

(Verse 2)
Thoughts keep running laps upstairs,
Static buzzing, no one cares.
I’m pure honey with a razor tongue,
You want sweet? Well, you picked the wrong one.

Fudge work, fudge your rules,
Fudge your smirk—I’m no fool.
Grip my boots, lace ’em tight,
I’ll scream this city into the night.

(Outro)
This is pure honey—now fudge off.
Hear me roar, don’t scoff.
I’m chaos wrapped in a cigarette laugh,
I’ll take my world back, back, back.</p>
