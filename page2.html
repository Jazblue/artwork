p<Bring it [Flirt Chaos – spoken/shouted to audience member]

Me: “Oi! Yeah, you there, with the muscles! Stop looking so smug, you little show-off… yeah, you know who you are!”
Crowd: cheers/laughs

Me: “Come on, babe! Don’t be shy… bring that over here!”
Crowd: shouts “BRING IT!”

Me (leaning in, chaotic, flirty):
“What’s your name? Huh? Don’t just stand there flexing like a daft plank… I like a man who can handle a bit of chaos. Can you handle me? Can you handle this madness?”
Crowd: laughs, whoops

Me (shouting):
“You think you’re fit? Ha! That’s cute… but can you survive a punk gig with me? Can you take my cat’s attitude, my FUDGE OFF energy, my honey chaos?!”
Crowd: shouts back “YEAH!”

Me (pointing, teasing):
“Come closer, or are you too scared? Oh, don’t be shy… bring your thing to me!”
Crowd: shouts “BRING IT!”

Me (laughing, dramatic, chaotic):
“I like it… I like it when they try… you lot are jealous now, aren’t ya? But this one’s mine for tonight! Just don’t fudge it up, babe… FUDGE OFF distractions!”
Crowd: cheers

Me (to audience member, playfully):
“And if you’re still thinking about Liam… F O Liam! F O Liam! Forget him, yeah? We’ve got chaos, we’ve got love, and we’ve got YOU!”
Crowd: chants “F O LIAM!”
