<p>Oi! You lot know I love my cat, right?
Still got that chaotic streak…
Fudge off, dog! Woof woof!
Go and slash somewhere else, leave my cat alone!
Crowd: “FUDGE OFF!”

Me: “Who loves cats?”
Crowd: cheers
Me: “Who’s done with dogs barging in?”
Crowd: “FUDGE OFF!”
Me: “And my cat?”
Crowd: “PURFEEECT HONEY!”

Me (shouting): “And oh yes…”
Crowd: “F O Liam! F O Liam!”</p>
