      <p>Lights come up, hearts start to race,
We’ve got fire running through this place.
Every heartbeat drums the same,
Chasing glory, shouting names!

(Pre-Chorus)
No fear, no fall,
We’re breaking through it all.

(Chorus)
Rise up tonight — feel the thunder roll,
Hands to the sky, never letting go.
We run, we fight, we shine like the sun,
Energy high — we’re the chosen ones! ⚡

(Verse 2)
Echoes bouncing off the stands,
Dreams built strong in calloused hands.
One voice, one team, one sound,
This is where our souls are found.

(Bridge)
Ohh, every scar tells a story,
Every loss builds the glory —
We’ll burn bright till the night is done,
Hearts united, beating as one!

(Final Chorus)
Rise up tonight — we’re alive, we run,
Chasing the stars till the morning comes.
No holding back, no giving in —
This is our time, let the fight begin!  </p>

     <p> (Chorus)
Ohhh, I’m flying high on AWS,
Where my dreams deploy, no need to stress.
From Lambda lights to Dynamo nights,
Scaling up my world, everything’s right!

(Verse 2)
CloudWatch eyes keeping logs in sight,
IAM rules keeping access tight.
VPC dreams, we’re subnet deep,
Auto-scaling armies never sleep!

(Bridge)
Got my CloudTrail runnin’, tracking the show,
Terraform builds wherever I go.
From Manchester skies to London rain,
The cloud’s my stage, I’m on the mainframe!

(Final Chorus)
Ohhh, I’m flying high on AWS,
Where uptime shines and I’m truly blessed.
From Lambda love to Route 53,
The cloud’s my jam — it’s home to me! ☁️ </p>

      <p>[Verse 1 – Him]
Yeah, city lights flicker on the Thames at night,
I’ve been grindin’ for the dream, tryna get it right.
Bus stop talks, cold air, mid-December,
Stackin’ wins now, I’ll make ‘em remember.

[Verse 2 – Her]
You chat about grind but I’ve lived that fight,
North side queen with my aim in sight.
No silver spoon, just tea and grit,
I turn pain into art, that’s my ultimate hit.

[Hook – Both]
We don’t sleep, nah, we move till dawn,
From the flats to the stage, new kings reborn.
Bassline bumpin’, hearts in sync,
One shot, no blink, yeah — we’re on the brink.

[Verse 3 – Him]
I came from the grey, made colour outta struggle,
Now I talk goals, no time for the subtle.
See her on the mic? Best mind your tone,
She’ll flip the script, then claim the throne.

[Verse 4 – Her]
Don’t gas me up, I’m the spark and flame,
Words cut deep like a London rain.
He’s the calm, I’m the storm — that’s the blend,
Two sides, one vibe, till the very end.

[Bridge – Both]
(He) Late nights, take flights, dream in motion,
(She) Big moves, real talk, pure devotion.
(He) No fear when the beat drops,
(She) We rise — no ceiling, no stops!

[Final Hook – Both]
We don’t sleep, nah, we move till dawn,
From the flats to the stage, new kings reborn.
Bassline bumpin’, hearts in sync,
One shot, no blink — what you think?

(Pre-Chorus)
No fear, no fall,
We’re breaking through it all.

(Chorus)
Rise up tonight — feel the thunder roll,
Hands to the sky, never letting go.
We run, we fight, we shine like the sun,
Energy high — we’re the chosen ones! ⚡

(Verse 2)
Echoes bouncing off the stands,
Dreams built strong in calloused hands.
One voice, one team, one sound,
This is where our souls are found.

(Bridge)
Ohh, every scar tells a story,
Every loss builds the glory —
We’ll burn bright till the night is done,
Hearts united, beating as one!

(Final Chorus)
Rise up tonight — we’re alive, we run,
Chasing the stars till the morning comes.
No holding back, no giving in —
This is our time, let the fight begin! 🔥

      <p>(Verse 1)
Yeah, they sell us dreams on the six o’clock news,
But behind those screens, they just bendin’ the truth.
Justice blindfolded, can’t see who’s who,
Rich man walks, poor man pays dues.

They tell us “trust the system,” but the system’s broke,
Paper laws burnin’ while the people choke.
Courts in chaos, verdicts bought and sold,
We scream for fairness, but the world stays cold.

(Chorus)
Where’s the truth when the liars run the show?
Who’s the voice when the honest got no home?
Media preach, but their morals gone ghost,
We just want fairness, yeah, that matters most.

(Verse 2)
Mentors lost, idols sold their soul,
Trading truth for clicks, that control the scroll.
Politicians posing with their “honour” badge,
While the youth out here tryna dodge the trap.

The mirror cracked — reflection distorted,
Facts twisted up, justice contorted.
Society’s blindfold slipping down slow,
We see the game now, we just want to know.

(Bridge)
Can’t build peace on a lie that’s disguised,
Can’t fix trust when the truth’s been denied.
If we all stand up, no divide, no side,
Maybe then justice could finally rise.

(Outro)
So here’s to the people, tired but aware,
Fighting for a system that’s honest and fair.
We don’t need kings, we don’t need crowns,
Just truth that stands when the lies fall down.</p>

      <p>Snow boots on, it’s go-time, baby,
Santa’s on the mic, yeah, the North Pole’s crazy,
Rudolph got the lights like a disco show,
Red nose glow when the bassline blows.

Cookies on the dash, milk on ice,
Mrs. Claus lookin’ cool, she don’t think twice,
Snapback Santa in a velvet coat,
He’s droppin’ those gifts like he wrote that note.

(Chorus)
Ho, ho, ho — Santa’s got that sleigh flow,
Rudolph in the front, shining like a halo,
Slide through the clouds, drop the beat real low,
It’s Christmas Eve, yeah, the vibes gon’ glow.

(Verse 2)
Elves in the workshop bumpin’ trap,
Making that magic while they rap that wrap,
Candy cane chain, reindeer fame,
Rudolph’s on fire — lightin’ up the game.

Snowflakes fallin’, lights all flicker,
Eggnog pourin’, playlist sicker,
North Pole party, 808s kick,
Even Frosty’s out here takin’ pics.

(Bridge)
Sleigh bells ring with a modern twist,
Tinsel drip with a lo-fi mix,
Santa said, “Yo, we don’t do stress,
We sleigh all day, then we chill, no less.”

(Final Chorus)
Ho, ho, ho — Santa’s got that sleigh flow,
Rudolph in the front, leading like a pro,
Slide through the stars, let the good vibes show,
It’s Christmas now — and we run that snow.</p>
